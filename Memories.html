              <p class="ly-stxt01">Happy Birthday, My dearest!❤️</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt02">I started off just trying to find a creative way 
                to wish you a happy birthday</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt03">But my overly excited, after-midnight self decided</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt04">Why not learn how to code and make a virtual gift in a month?</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt05">Spoiler alert: I regretted that decision more than once when 
                the code was more error messages than working lines…</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ly-txt02">
              <p class="ly-stxt06">I hope this little surprise brings a smile to your face. If not,
                at least we’ll know it wasn’t my coding skills that caused it!</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt07"> And if this doesn’t work, blame the WiFi. It’s always the WiFi</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt08">It might not be perfect, but it’s definitely unique—just like us</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt09">You deserve so much more, but I hope this shows 
                a small fraction of how much you mean to me</p>
              <p class="ly-stxt10">I hope your birthday is as unforgettable as I am</p>

                 <p>First time we met</p>
			     <p>I kicked off this timeline because I wanted to make our story feel
                     like it started even earlier—longer, fuller, like a Netflix series. 
                 </p>
			     <p>But the truth? Our first real meeting was brief—less than a day, 
                    and we were both a little younger. You were 24, I was 9, </p>
			     <p> and we were just two awkward strangers at a family gathering. 
                    You probably don’t remember it...but hey I do</p>
				 <p>Back then, I had no idea what was coming. You were a 24-year-old ‘grown-up,’ 
                    and I was just trying to avoid getting caught drawing on the walls at home.</p>
				 <p>Now, look at us—stuck in a virtual world, but still figuring it all out.</p>

                For a second, I thought my brain crashed. I stared at the message, processing…
                13 years had passed, yet somehow, in that moment, it felt like none at all.
                And just like that, our story restarted.
